Transform your WooCommerce store with a beautiful floating cart. Let customers shop faster with side cart, drag & drop, and instant checkout.

== Description ==

Tired of losing customers during checkout? Quick Cart Shopping is here to change that.

This lightweight plugin adds a sleek floating cart to your WooCommerce store that stays with customers as they browse. No more cart page redirects. No more interrupting the shopping flow. Just smooth, seamless cart management that keeps customers engaged and ready to buy.

**Here's what makes it special:**

Your customers can add products, update quantities, and even complete checkout—all without leaving the page they're on. The floating cart icon sits quietly on your site, ready whenever they need it. Click it, and boom—a beautiful side cart or popup appears with everything they need.

But we didn't stop there. We added drag and drop functionality because, honestly, it's just cool. Your customers can literally drag products straight into the floating cart. It's intuitive, it's fast, and it makes shopping feel effortless.

Variable products? No problem. When someone tries to add a product with variations, a clean popup appears where they can select size, color, or whatever options you've set up. No confusion, no mistakes—just the right product, every time.

**What You Get (Free Version)**

* **Floating Cart Icon** – Works on every page of your site. Your customers never lose sight of their cart.
* **Side Cart & Popup Cart** – Choose the layout that fits your store's vibe. Both look amazing.
* **Drag & Drop Magic** – Let customers drag products straight into the cart. Seriously, try it—it's satisfying.
* **Smart Variation Handling** – Variable products open in a popup so customers can pick the exact option they want.
* **AJAX Updates** – Everything happens instantly. No page reloads, no waiting, no frustration.
* **Works Everywhere** – Home page, shop page, product page—it doesn't matter. The cart follows them.
* **Lightning Fast** – We obsessed over performance. This plugin won't slow down your site.
* **Works with Any Theme** – Whether you're using Astra, Kadence, or a custom theme, it just works.

**Pro Version (Coming Soon)**

Want to take it even further? The Pro version is packed with features that turn browsers into buyers:

* **Multi-Step Checkout in Cart** – Complete the entire checkout process without leaving the cart. Fewer clicks = more sales.
* **Smart Upsells** – Show related products right inside the cart to increase average order value.
* **Custom Checkout Fields** – Add special instructions, gift messages, or any custom field you need.
* **Advanced Styling Options** – Make the cart match your brand perfectly with full customization controls.
* **Priority Support** – Get help fast when you need it.

**Why Customers Leave (And How This Plugin Stops That)**

Most online stores have the same problem: too many steps between "I want this" and "Order complete." Every page reload is a chance for customers to change their mind. Every extra click is a chance for them to leave.

Quick Cart Shopping removes those friction points. Customers stay on the page they're browsing. They see their cart update in real-time. They feel in control. And when checkout is just a click away (especially with the Pro version), they're much more likely to complete the purchase.

**Real Results You Can Expect**

* Faster shopping experience (customers love not waiting for page loads)
* Lower cart abandonment rates (fewer steps = fewer opportunities to leave)
* Higher engagement (interactive features like drag & drop keep people interested)
* Better mobile experience (the floating cart is perfect for small screens)
* Increased conversions (removing friction from checkout always helps sales)

**Perfect For:**

* Fashion and apparel stores
* Electronics shops
* Handmade and craft stores
* Dropshipping stores
* Any WooCommerce store that wants happier customers and more sales

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work with my theme? =

Yes! We've tested it with dozens of popular themes including Astra, Kadence, OceanWP, Storefront, and more. It's designed to work independently of your theme's cart template, so compatibility is never an issue.

= Does it work with variable products? =

Absolutely. When someone tries to add a variable product (like a shirt with different sizes), a popup appears where they can select the exact variation they want. No guesswork, no mistakes.

= Can I use both side cart and popup cart? =

You can switch between them anytime, but only one layout is active at a time. Choose the one that fits your store's design best.

= Will this slow down my website? =

Not at all. We're a bit obsessed with performance. The plugin only loads the necessary assets on pages where they're needed, and the code is optimized to be as lightweight as possible. Your site speed won't suffer.

= Is drag and drop really necessary? =

Necessary? Maybe not. Awesome? Absolutely. It's one of those features that makes shopping feel modern and interactive. Customers love it, and it sets your store apart.

= Does it work on mobile? =

Yes! In fact, the floating cart experience is even better on mobile. The side cart or popup appears perfectly sized for small screens, making mobile checkout smooth and easy.

= Can I customize the colors and styling? =

The free version includes basic styling options that match most themes automatically. The Pro version gives you full control over colors, fonts, and layout customization.

= Is checkout included in the free version? =

The free version shows your cart beautifully and lets customers manage their items. For full multi-step checkout inside the cart (so they never leave the page), you'll need the Pro version.

= What about shipping calculations? =

The cart shows shipping options just like the regular WooCommerce cart. If you have shipping zones and methods set up, they'll appear in the floating cart automatically.

= Does it work with coupons? =

Yes! Customers can apply discount codes directly in the floating cart.
