Quick Cart Shopping adds a fast floating cart to WooCommerce with side cart, popup cart, drag & drop support, and instant product interaction.

== Description ==

Quick Cart Shopping is a lightweight WooCommerce plugin that improves the shopping experience by allowing customers to view and manage their cart without leaving the current page.

The plugin introduces a floating cart icon that can appear anywhere on your site and works on all WooCommerce pages. Customers can open the cart as a **side cart** or **popup cart**, add products instantly, and even drag products directly into the floating cart.

Variation products are handled smoothly with a popup selector, ensuring customers choose the correct options before adding items to the cart.

This plugin is built for store owners who want faster checkout flow, better user experience, and higher conversion rates — without bloated features or heavy scripts.

== Why Use Quick Cart Shopping? ==

Most WooCommerce stores lose customers during page reloads and long checkout processes. Quick Cart Shopping removes unnecessary steps by keeping the customer on the same page while interacting with the cart and checkout.

This results in:
* Faster shopping experience
* Reduced cart abandonment
* Higher engagement
* Better conversions

2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" screen in WordPress.
3. Go to WooCommerce and start using the floating cart automatically.

No additional configuration is required for basic usage.
